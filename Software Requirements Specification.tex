	Response:   & Prompts user to fill out basic account information, creates a new user profile in database. Also asks them to authenticate with Canvas to automatically suggest classes. \\ \hline
	Stimulus:   & User logs in not for the first time. \\

	Response 2: & Check Canvas for new assignments. \\ \hline
	Stimulus:   & User edits his/her profile information or joins more courses. \\
