\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
This design document describes the overall structure of the Class Collaboration Application (CCA) by outlining significant aspects of the system’s architecture.


\section{Scope}
This application will be used for students at Case Western Reserve University to collaborate and discuss specific courses they are in with other students. Some of the key features of this application are that students will be able to chat with other students in the course, upload class notes or other miscellaneous documents to discuss, and ask questions. Users will also be able to download any documents uploaded for a course that they are enrolled in and can personalize their own account on the CCA. 

\section{Acronyms, Abbreviations and Definitions}
\textit{CCA (Class Collaboration Application)} - Acronym of the name of the application.  \\
\textit{PaaS (Platform as a Service)} - Acronym of a cloud computing platform. \\
\textit{IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)} - Acronym of a cloud computing infrastructure.\\
\textit{VM (Virtual Machine)} - Acronym of virtual machine. \\
\textit{SSO (Single Sign-On)} - Acronym of a tool for access control across several independent software systems. 

\section{Overview}
This document is an overview of the software architecture of the Class Collaboration Application in high detail. We start by providing all the principal classes that the application is built on as well as their responsibilities to the success of the application. Next, we provide diagrams to show the hierarchy of our classes and the architectural design. Finally, we develop a general API of the major class methods used to build the functionality of our application. There are also mockups of our UI design included in our design document.

% PRINCIPAL CLASSES %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chapter{Principal Classes}
	
\section{Student}
The student class contains all user information including student ID, the name of the student, the courses they are enrolled in, their username and the last time they logged in. A new student is created by checking whether a specific user has previously logged into the Class Collaboration Application.
\subsection{Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Monitoring the current session of the user.
	\item Querying any user updates in the database. 
	\item Displays all the courses the student is enrolled in. 
	\item Recording when the user has gone idle. 
	\item Uploads and removes documents their own documents.
	\item Can create CourseItems for a specific course.
	\item Can join or create courses.
\end{itemize}

\section{Course}
A Course class is able to aggregate all of the information and student created objects that are associated with a particular course. Created objects include all of the CourseItem objects associated with the Course and a single Chat object to be used as the general chat for the Course.
\subsection{Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Presenting to the user all CourseItem objects that have been added to the course from all Students 
	\item Presenting the Chat object for the course to allow communication between the Student and all other Students with the chat object
	\item Querying any updates to the Course objects and updating the CourseItem and Chat objects
\end{itemize}

\section{CourseItem}
A Course Item class is a reference to an assignment, exam, URL, or other document relevant to the course. The object in code will serve as a container and mainly server metadata information, while the document itself will be stored in the database. The CourseItem is a created object that is created by a user in the Student class and will be shared through a Course’s chat object and always accessible on the sidebar. The user who created the CourseItem object will be able to later modify or delete the object.
\subsection{Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Display to the user the name and description of the courseItem
	\item Allow the creator of the courseItem to modify or delete the courseItem
	\item Query any updates to the courseItem and update the courseItem accordingly
	\item Provide a download option so that a Student can download the contents of a course item
\end{itemize}

\section{Chat}
A chat is created for each Course and for each CourseItem. Chats are not created by or associated with users in any way, they are only automatically created/exist alongside existing Courses and CourseItems.
\subsection{Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tracking and recording to the database new messages in the chat. Messages are written to the database immediately (are not written to a buffer/flushed).
	\item Notifying the client of changes when the client checks (asks) whether any changes (new messages) have occurred.
	\item Providing specific messages upon request.
	\item Caching messages as they are accessed to reduce read operations on the database.
	\item Displaying active and offline users of chat channel
\end{itemize}

\section{Decomposition Description}

\section{Design Rationale}
\hspace{10mm}We have decided to use Google App Engine because it is a reliable platform to scale and build web applications. Many web applications are maintained either through IaaS or PaaS. We decided not to use Iaas because, although we can have root access to a VM, we would have to be responsible for managing the resources on the machine including, memory and CPU usage. Since Google App Engine is a PaaS, it manages all of our computational resources for us, so our only responsibility is maintaining the application while Google App Engine would take care of the infrastructure, security and scalability of the Class Collaboration Application. 

\hspace{10mm}For each user, we decided to integrate SSO into our application. Using SSO as a way for users to sign into the application through their Case credentials boosts our security capabilities as well as mitigates the risk of 3rd party applications accessing sensitive information about the user. This also improves user experience since the user does not have to create and keep track of another username and password.

\chapter{Class Interfaces}

\section{Class Student}
An instance of Student represents a user who can create CourseItems and Courses. A student is also able to upload Documents attached to a CourseItem.

\textit{Student(String name, String id, Time lastLogin)} \\
Creates a student object containing the name and Case ID.

\subsection{Public Method GetStudentID}
\textit{String GetStudentID()} \\
Returns the Case ID of the user.
